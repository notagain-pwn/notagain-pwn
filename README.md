## 🧭 About Me

I spent **5+ years working as a software engineer**, building web apps, APIs, and dev tools across various stacks.  

But beyond coding, I've always been fascinated by **how things break**, how systems can be abused, and how to secure them.  

That curiosity naturally led me to the world of **penetration testing**, **CTFs**, and **bug bounty hunting** — and I'm now transitioning full-time into cybersecurity.

## 🔍 My Focus Areas

- Web Application Security (OWASP, SSRF, IDOR, etc.)
- Capture The Flag challenges (HTB / TryHackMe / CTFtime)
- Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis
- Bug Bounty Programs (access to private programs on platforms like **Yogosha**)
